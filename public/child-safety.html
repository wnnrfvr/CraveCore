  <h1>CraveCore Child Safety and Protection Standards</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> April 5, 2025</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>1. Our Commitment to Child Safety</h2>
    <p>CraveCore is a platform designed exclusively for adults (18 years and older) seeking to build connections and relationships. Protecting children is a fundamental priority for us. These Standards outline our unwavering commitment and the measures we implement to prevent minors from accessing our platform and to protect children from harm, including exploitation and abuse online.</p>
    <p>We maintain a zero-tolerance policy towards any activity on our platform that exploits, endangers, or involves minors.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>2. Strict Age Requirement: Adults Only (18+)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No Minors Allowed:</strong> We explicitly forbid anyone under 18 from creating an account or using our services.</li>
      <li><strong>Age Affirmation:</strong> All users must affirm they are 18 or older during the registration process. We employ age-gating mechanisms as a first line of defense.</li>
      <li><strong>Representation:</strong> Creating an account signifies a binding representation by the user that they meet the minimum age requirement. Misrepresentation of age is a violation of our Terms of Service.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>3. Preventing Access by Minors</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Age Gate:</strong> We implement an age gate during registration requiring users to confirm they are 18 or older.</li>
      <li><strong>Monitoring & Detection:</strong> We utilize a combination of automated tools and human review (where applicable) to identify potential signs of underage users.</li>
      <li><strong>Verification (Potential):</strong> In cases where age is questioned or reported, we may request age verification before continued access, where legally permissible.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>4. Immediate Action Upon Discovery of Underage Users</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Swift Investigation:</strong> We will promptly investigate the report or suspicion.</li>
      <li><strong>Immediate Account Termination:</strong> Upon confirmation or suspicion, underage accounts will be terminated.</li>
      <li><strong>Data Deletion:</strong> Personal data associated with underage accounts will be deleted per policy and law.</li>
      <li><strong>Reporting Obligations:</strong> Evidence of child endangerment may be reported to authorities or child protection agencies.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>5. Prohibiting Harmful Content & Conduct</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Zero Tolerance for CSAM:</strong> Any Child Sexual Abuse Material is immediately removed and reported.</li>
      <li><strong>Prohibition of Grooming & Solicitation:</strong> Attempts to engage with minors result in immediate action and reporting.</li>
      <li><strong>Content Moderation:</strong> We use moderation tools to detect and remove harmful content.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>6. User Reporting Mechanisms</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>In-App Reporting:</strong> Users can report underage use or abuse through the app.</li>
      <li><strong>Direct Reporting:</strong> Users can contact our safety team via email.</li>
      <li><strong>Prioritization:</strong> Reports related to child safety are treated with top priority.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>7. Cooperation with Law Enforcement</h2>
    <p>CraveCore cooperates fully with law enforcement agencies in investigations involving child exploitation or abuse, subject to applicable laws and legal processes.</p>
